== DESCRIPTION == 

&#10067; Have you thought about creating an international multi-seller platform, giving your vendors from different countries the ability to define the currency that suits them for their store operations?  &#10067;

   👉 This greatly increases the likelihood of sellers from different countries subscribing to your marketplace.
   
   👉 Over 95% of online vendors prefer to create their products and receive payment in their own currency.
   
   👉 Handle the multiple currencies of your buyers, sellers, also yours, for detection, conversion, display, format, dashboards, withdraws, gateways, orders, emails notifications, including extensions for shipping, taxes calculation, checkout, worldwide payment methods, products addons, and more.
   
   👉 Best currency plugin for [WCFM (WCFM - Marketplace App)](https://wcfm.app/) for currency conversion, compatible with WCFM Marketplace.
   
&#9888; This plugin extends the functionality of the [SCD - smart currency detector plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/scd-smart-currency-detector/). It is recommended to install and activate the [SCD - smart currency detector plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/scd-smart-currency-detector/)  before using this plugin. If you do not have the [SCD - smart currency detector plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/scd-smart-currency-detector/) yet, please download it [here.](https://wordpress.org/plugins/scd-smart-currency-detector/)
   
**Here a glimpse on the features it contains.**

👉 Most of the time, the vendors and the marketplace owner don‘t live in the same country nor have the same currency. Thus each vendor can handle his own shop using his own currency, and same for the marketplace owner, which defines the currency of his marketplace.

👉 The vendor can also, after setting its own default(shop) currency, specify whether its product price will be set in his default currency or in the websites(base) currency.

👉 The vendor's own currency is also the one visible within its dashboard.
It means the vendor's sales are summarized using his currency and of course the specific amounts.
This depends on the settings chosen by the vendor. If the vendor choosed to set his product prices in the website(base) currency, his dashboard will be using this currency as well.

👉 The vendor’s own currency is also the one visible within his orders overview.
Take the same vendor as an example, which has USD as its own currency.

👉 Admins dashboard is coherent to all vendors dashboards totgeher and brings an overall report in the admins(websites) currency

👉 The admins withdrawal page is adapted accordingly. 

👉 Then vendors withdrawal page is also adapted accordingly.

👉 Compatible with the Dokan stripe connect module which allows split payment during a purchase. 

👉 Compatibility with many other plugins that require to get a plugin addons from the site [gajelabs.com](https://gajelabs.com/)
